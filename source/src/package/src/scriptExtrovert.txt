Hi, how are you? We are very happy you are here. Welcome.
Are you comfortable? \\pau=250\\ We are going to tell you about diabetes type one. Let's start.
Maybe you know a kid that always eats a snack during a soccer game. Or maybe he goes to the school nurse before lunch to get a shot. If you have a friend like this, \\pau=250\\ or this sounds just like you, \\pau=250\\ you are not alone.
A lot of kids all over the world do stuff like this every day because they have type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is a disease. It affects how the body uses glucose. Glucose is a sugar that is the body's main source of energy.
Your body needs glucose to keep running. When you eat, glucose from the food gets into your veins. Your pancreas makes a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps the glucose get into the body's cells. Just like that, your body gets the energy it needs.
The pancreas is an organ in your belly. That organ helps your body process food. It also makes insulin. Insulin is kind of like a key that opens the doors to the cells of the body. It lets the glucose in.
Then the glucose can move out of the blood and into the cells. But if someone has diabetes, the body either cannot make insulin or the insulin does not work in the body like it should.
The glucose cannot get into the cells normally. And then, the blood sugar level gets too high. Lots of sugar in the blood makes people sick if they do not see a doctor.
Kids who have type 1 diabetes have to pay a little more attention to what they are eating and doing than kids without diabetes. 
They need to take insulin as their doctor told them to, \\pau=250\\ eat a healthy and balanced diet counting the carbohydrates, check blood sugar levels as their doctor showed them, and finally, \\pau=250\\ do sports regularly.
That's been all. You have been a great audience!
Thanks a lot for your time. See you!
