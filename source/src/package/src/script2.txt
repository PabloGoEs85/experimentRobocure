Maybe a kid you know always eats a snack during a soccer game or goes to the school nurse before lunch to get a shot.
If you have a friend or a classmate like this, or this sounds just like you, you are not alone. 
Thousands of kids all over the world do stuff like this every day because they have type 1 diabetes. 
Diabetes is a disease that affects how the body uses glucose. That is a sugar that is the body's main source of fuel. 
Your body needs glucose to keep running. When you eat, glucose from the food gets into your bloodstream.
Your pancreas makes a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps the glucose get into the body's cells. So that, your body gets the energy it needs.
The pancreas is a long flat gland in your belly that helps your body digest food. It also makes insulin. 
Insulin is kind of like a key that opens the doors to the cells of the body. It lets the glucose in. 
Then the glucose can move out of the blood and into the cells. But if someone has diabetes, the body either cannot make insulin or the insulin does not work in the body like it should. 
The glucose cannot get into the cells normally, so the blood sugar level gets too high. Lots of sugar in the blood makes people sick if they do not get treatment.
