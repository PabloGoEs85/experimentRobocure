Hello. How are you? My friend and I are very pleased that you are here. Welcome.
Hopefully you are comfortable, during the next few minutes my friend and I are going to tell you a little bit more about diabetes type one. Let's begin.
Maybe \\pau=250\\ someone you know always eats a snack while doing exercise \\pau=250\\ or goes to the school nurse before lunch to get a shot. If you have a friend \\pau=350\\ or a classmate like this, or this sounds just like you, you are not alone.
Thousands of kids all over the world \\pau=350\\ do these things every day \\pau=250\\ because they have type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is a disease that affects how the body uses glucose. That is a sugar that is the body's main source of fuel.
Your body needs glucose to keep running. When you eat, \\pau=350\\ glucose from the food gets into your bloodstream. Your pancreas produces a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps the glucose get into the body's cells. So that, your body gets the energy it needs.
The pancreas is a long, flat gland in your abdomen \\pau=250\\ that helps your body digest food. It also produces insulin. Insulin can be seen \\pau=250\\ as a key that opens the doors to the cells of the body. It lets the glucose in.
Then the glucose can move out of the blood \\pau=250\\ and into the cells. But if someone has diabetes, the body either cannot produce insulin \\pau=350\\ or the insulin does not work in the body like it should.
The glucose cannot get into the cells normally, so the blood sugar level gets too high. Excesive sugar in the blood can be a problem for your health if you do not get treatment.
Children who have type 1 diabetes \\pau=250\\ have to be more cautious about what they are eating and doing \\pau=250\\ than children without diabetes. 
Especially, they need to take insulin as their doctor prescribed, \\pau=250\\ eat a healthy and balanced diet with accurate carbohydrate counts, check blood sugar levels as prescribed and finally, \\pau=250\\ get regular exercise.
I think that has been all. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
We really appreciate your time. Thank you for coming.
